# SoftwareTesting
This repository showcases a versatile range of functional and non-functional testing methodologies, applied across **Android and iOS mobile apps, web applications, desktop applications, and software products** developed by Tomy George, a software tester with 5 years of experience. It includes testing strategies, test plans, and scripts across various domains, including desktop, web, and mobile applications. The framework focuses on functional and non-functional testing.

***Testing Methods:***

**Functional Testing Methods:**

**Unit Testing:** Each individual unit or component of the web application or software product is tested in isolation to ensure that all functionalities operate as expected.


**Integration Testing:** After unit testing, integrated modules are tested together to verify that their interactions produce the expected results.


**System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the entire system, ensuring that the software works as a whole and all integrated components are functioning properly.


**Regression Testing:** After updates or bug fixes, I re-test the system to confirm that previous functionalities are still working and no new bugs have been introduced.


**Smoke Testing:** I perform a basic check of the application to ensure critical functionalities work before moving on to more rigorous testing.


**Sanity Testing:** Focused testing to verify the logic of the code changes or bug fixes, ensuring that the specific functionality works as intended.


**User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: This testing phase ensures that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for release by validating it from the end-user's perspective.


**Interface Testing:** I validate that different modules and systems interact properly, including the exchange of data across APIs or user interfaces.


**Ad-hoc Testing:** Unplanned testing done without formal documentation, aiming to identify defects that may not be covered by formal test cases.


**Boundary Value Analysis:** I test the limits of input values to ensure the system handles edge cases correctly.


**Component Testing:** Individual components or functions of the application are tested in isolation to ensure that they meet their design specifications.


**Decision Table Testing:** A systematic approach where I test the application based on different combinations of input conditions and their expected outcomes.


**Usability Testing:** Evaluating the user-friendliness and overall experience of the application, ensuring that the UI/UX is intuitive and accessible.


**API Testing:** Testing the APIs to ensure they are secure, reliable, and return the expected responses under various conditions.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Non-Functional Testing Methods:***


**Performance Testing:** I assess the responsiveness, stability, and speed of the system under different conditions to ensure that it meets the required performance benchmarks.

**Load Testing:** Using tools like JMeter, I simulate a high volume of users to evaluate how the application behaves under expected and peak loads.
